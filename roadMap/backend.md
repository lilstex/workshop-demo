# Complete Backend Development Roadmap (Beginner to Job-Ready in 4 Months)

## Overview

This 4-month roadmap offers a clear, practical progression from backend fundamentals to building full-stack production-ready applications with databases, authentication, and REST APIs. Each phase includes hands-on projects, essential tooling, and key concepts.

> Note: This roadmap assumes you pick **one** backend language and framework to specialize in (**Node.js with Express**, **Python with Flask/FastAPI**, or **PHP with Laravel**). Mastering one is enough to get job-ready. Exploring the others can come later.
