## 💡 Tasks You Can Complete Using AI Tools

This project encourages the use of **AI pair-programming** tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or DeepSeek to explore and build additional features.

Here are some **AI-assisted tasks** you can try:

- ✅ **Add a confirmation message** before deleting a student or course record (e.g., with a browser prompt).
- ✅ **Add flash messages** to notify users when a record is created, updated, or deleted.
- ✅ **Generate full application documentation** (e.g., using ChatGPT or deepseek).

> These exercises will help reinforce how AI tools can support you in writing, refactoring, and documenting code.
